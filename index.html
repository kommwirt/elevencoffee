          <h2 class="smallh2">Our story</h2>
          <p>
            I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs
            after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no
            catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
            was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and
            all the customers were guests in my home.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="full">
          <div class="fifty">
            <p>
              After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not
              yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of
              being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food
              I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site
              and served immediately to our guests.
